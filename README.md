Falco office hours gives the Falco community a common time to come together to discuss any open issues or PRs, new features, rules, upcoming releases, etc. Anyone can join, anyone can ask questions in the designed time but only the MC and the designed speakers (those that had allocated 10 mins slot during the week) will present. After every call, a report will be published in this repository with a summary of the call.

Topics are proposed and voted in the office-hours repo by opening an issue, and the most upvoted issues have a chance to be addressed on the upcoming call. The less upvoted are kept for the preceeding call (or can be discussed if time allows on the current call). The MC for the week takes care of reaching out to the issue owner about participating in the upcoming call.

Note: If you want to debug problems together, look at [DEBUGGING_HOURS.md](DEBUGGING_HOURS.md)
