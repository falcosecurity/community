## Community Calls

These are the primary calls for The Falco Project. If you are unsure where to get started, this is the place to join.

**When**: [Weekly Community Calls on Wednesday](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-falco-dev/calendar) at UTC 4pm.

You can see the Falco Calendar [here](https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-falco-dev/calendar) .

```


**Where**: [Zoom call](https://zoom.us/my/cncffalcoproject)

Falco Community calls gives the Falco community a common time to come together to discuss any open issues or PRs, new features, rules, upcoming releases, etc.
Anyone can join, anyone can ask questions in the designed time but only the MC and the designed speakers (those that had allocated 10 mins slot during the week) will present. 
After every call, a report will be [published in this repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/community/tree/master/meeting-notes) with a summary of the call.

**Minutes**: We use the same [hackmd](https://hackmd.io/3qYPnZPUQLGKCzR14va_qg?both) document every week to track our minutes.

**History**: [Check out the YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7LDOK1nN5jIULHk-LJJtA)

All of our calls are documented and posted to the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7LDOK1nN5jIULHk-LJJtA). 

### Running a call

Regardless if you are interested in starting a new call, or running an existing call we have some structure in place to drive these calls.

 - All new calls should include a calendar invite sent to the mailing list's email address [cncf-falco-dev@lists.cncf.io](mailto:cncf-falco-dev@lists.cncf.io), as well as a short description of the call and the goals.
 - All calls should be recorded and published to the [Falco YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd7LDOK1nN5jIULHk-LJJtA) 
    - _Note_: Please contact a maintainer for access to the channel if you need to upload a video. 
 - All calls should have written minutes using [hackmd.io](https://hackmd.io). Ideally the minutes are posted in advance to give collaborators a chance to add items before the meeting. After the meeting the notes should be closed, and uploaded to this repository.
     - _Note_: The template used for the Falco Community Calls can be [found here](meeting-note-template.md)
 - All calls must adhere to [the CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
