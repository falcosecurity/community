Next, the blog editor will review the content for any grammatical errors, spelling mistakes, technical accuracy, and provide feedback. All feedback and collaboration will take place in the Github Pull Request.

Depending on where your blog falls in the queue, editing and publication dates will vary. Blog content is reviewed and published on a first come, first serve basis. This step should take 5 - 7 business days to complete.

The goal is to publish 1 blog per week and the community commits to a 2 week(s) turnaround end to end. 

**Publishing process**

* Once the editor and contributor are done with the editing process, the blog should publish when the next available slot opens up.
