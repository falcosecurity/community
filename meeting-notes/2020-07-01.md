### Agenda

- We had an issue with Cilium in our infrastructure's k8s cluster - we still need to dedicate some care documenting it
    - fntlnz to submit a MD documentation file (into test-infra repo) about Cilium setup on packet falco infrastructure
- We still miss Poiana on falcosidekick, why? Do we want to enable Prow on it? I'd like to have on all the repos of falcosecurity (leodido).
    - First we need OWNERS containing maintainers [falcosidekick#63](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick/issues/63)
    - Issue for tracking is [test-infra#146](https://github.com/falcosecurity/test-infra/issues/146)
    - leodido to create the poiana policies etc.
- [leodido] What to do with other repos without policies and maintainers like katacoda?
    - [kris] Move to evolution?
    - [fntlnz] Archive?
    - [kris] Create a "legacy" section into the evolution repository.
    - [leogr] Against move to evolution
    - [kris] Modify the title of repo candidate for deprecation/archive
    - kris to create the issue template on falcosecurity/.github
    - fntlnz, leodido, leogr to create a list of deprecation candidates by next week call
- [nova] CNCF Helpdesk
    - Names here for getting added to helpdesk
- [nova] Falco in a browser on Falco.org
- [nova] Monthly Planning after July 16 release (2 hours)
    - [leodido] ok as soon we do this grooming session after some time, not the day after the release to give time to the community and also the maintainers to discover bugs and new things that should go into the successive release
    - [fntlnz] document the process in the RELEASE.md
    - [leogr] +1
 - [leodido/fntlnz] Sync client-go with the new bidirectional Falco outputs gRPC API
    - PR [client-go#45](https://github.com/falcosecurity/client-go/pull/45)
    - Volunteers for doing the same on client-py and/or client-rs? :)
    - [spencer] volunteered to update the client-py to the new bidirectional gRPC outputs API
- [leodido/fntlnz] Sync Falco website docs with the new bidirectional Falco outputs gRPC API
    - PR [falco-website#216](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/pull/216)
