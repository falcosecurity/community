### Agenda

- Release of Falco 0.18.0 - @leodido - [falco#904](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/904)
- Falco eBPF probe seems to lock 4.19 kernels - @leodido - [falco#896](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/896)
- Usage of the CNCF infrastructure lab for prow and testing (test-infra) - @markyjackson or @rajibmitra https://cncf.io/cluster
  - @leodido explained why (and how) we need to separate the infrastructure of Falco from the Sysdig's one
- Introducing client-py - @rajibmitra - [client-py](https://github.com/falcosecurity/client-py)
- Repository Template and standardized readmes - @leodido - [community#51](https://github.com/falcosecurity/community/issues/51)
- repository template + .github repo - @leodido - [community#53](https://github.com/falcosecurity/community/issues/53)
- Poiana driven releases - @leodido - [community#52](https://github.com/falcosecurity/community/issues/52)
- Updates on CNCF incubation
- Replacing the Lua rules parser with a Ragel based parser - @leodido
    - go complatible
    - based on regular languages expressed via FSM (finite state automata)
    - can express recurrent structures looping between FSMs
    - faster (based on goto inlining of the FSM)
    - can generate parser for various languages with minimal modifications: C, C++, C#, Objective-C, ASM, Go, D, Java, Ruby
    - it can generate Graphviz documentation for the FSM, and from that images
    - @leodido showed/demoed it (private repo atm)
- Presentation of the Cloud Native Security Hub - @bencer or @nestorsalceda
    - needs help on css (need to track the issue)
    - there's a roadmap on gdrive --> maybe would be better to have it reported on github issues
    - postgres for resource versioning
    - todo: show the rule itself in the documentation
    - rules by minimum required version
    - integration with falcoctl
- Other options to build the probe for a specific kernel - @natch - [community#54](https://github.com/falcosecurity/community/issues/54), [falco#890](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/890)
  - @leodido proposed to create a new falcoctl command to build the probe for a given node's kernel (or for an explicitly specified kernel)
  - @natch volunteered to create the issue, and maybe contribute it
