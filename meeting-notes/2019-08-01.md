## Proposals/Issues

**Michael**: We started a process of weekly issue triaging. Since this week there are no proposals on the office-hours repo we are approaching the list of issues we think are top priority. For example we have an issue ([#740](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/740)) where there’s been a memory leak reported in Falco. I’ve tried to recreate and haven’t been able to. Mark have you heard of anything reported with sysdig or the agent?
**Mark**: No I’ve not heard anything of similar internally at the moment.
**Michael**: My own experience is that Falco is pretty stable in memory so this needs some debuggin, Lorenzo will reach out the author of the issue proposing to debug together it
**Michael**: Let’s switch to the slim docker image ([#532](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/532)), Mark do you have already approached this topic internally for the commercial side of the products?
**Mark**: Yes we are working on split the image in 2 pieces. And the base image will be alpine.
**Michael**: Leo we should reach to the team working on this to sync and see if there is maybe something we can use in Falco too.
**Leo**: Will do, sure.
**Michael**: Next issue, allow the use k8s audit only not loading the kernel module ([#725](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/725), [#730](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/730)). It’s not sure yet if this can be done at all or not. We believe that the container metadata part does not need the kernel module .. Let’s wait for Mark back on the call
**Michael**: Leo do you want to talk about the testing?
**Leo**: ([#704](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/704))We need unit tests for CII and techincal review of the CNCF incubation, and also for the community. At the moment we have just one unit test for the token_bucket and only the unit test framework (catch2) in place. While the integration tests are written in python 2 (which is end of life on 1st Jan 2020); so first of all we should refactor it to python 3. Also the integration tests contains path written in stone and not easily configurable from outside, which makes them easily to be run locally, slowing down the local development and also the community approaching Falco.
**Michael**: Thanks, let’s switch to discuss the drop messages ([#615](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/615), [#669](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/669), [#740#issuecomment-516051540](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/740#issuecomment-516051540)). Can we just disable the drops by default? Or having them just as logs not as alerts? Mark are you back on the call? Khaize wdyt? We should decide where to send those alerts.
Khaize: ...
**Michael**: Can you investigate with others (eg., Omer) what they think about this?
**Khaize**: Sure!
**Mark**: Log is fine with me. I dunno what security researchers would think of it. Maybe a better way would be to log the first one, and if you see the same event again emit an alert. Something smarter.
**Michael**: One question we had for you Mark is about the ability to turn off the module in case of k8s audit only use case. The k8s audit events will be lacking some information if we turn off the libsinsp? 
**Mark**: For the k8s audit event they already contain everything we need.
**Michael**: [#683](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/683), [#680](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/680) There are times when the inspector throws errors and we are not catching properly the exception.
**Leo**: The problem is that we don’t have a way to easily distinguish between the kind of exceptions. There are exceptions that needs to stop falco and other that we don’t care  (for example json parsing errors?) and can continue.
**Mark**: Why not just catching all the exceptions and reopen the inspector?
**Leo**: I have concerns that doing this way we’ll end up in a loop (think about issues in the kernel module)
**Michael**: [#629](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/629) issue about null k8s fields
**Leo**: This is fixed imho. There is only another situation - which imho is related to the k8s api timing in populating the container metadata - in which sometimes we don’t have the container image name. But it’s a spot one and it’s really hard to reproduce. Observed it happens more often when using containerd. Anyway, this is definitely another issue so this one can be closed.
**Leo**: [PR#758](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/758) This PR is about detecting liveness and presence of kernel module. explaining the concerns of using the events timestamp to check for it with a frequency versus using an external timer which will introduce an overhead but it’s not tied to the kernel module working correctly. I mean, if the kernel module does not behave correctly and we do not have the event we neither have a way to trigger the check on the kernel module.
