#### Falco download metrics

Michael shares the screen showing us the the metrics about:
- docker hub (falcosecurity/falco docker image) downloads
    - everyone uses latest tag
    - everyone's ImagePullPolicy is Always
- rpm/deb packages downloads
- graph about downloads, cool figures and numbers out there!
- what kernel modules are generating more 404s
    - falco-probe-0.15.0 4.14.128 amzn2
- Metrics are collected by using athena
- Thomas suggest ways of identify who is downloading the probes.
- Key can be divided to get version and kernel info
- Michael says we should also start pre-compile BPF probes. Right now we are not doing it.
- Next steps are to get logs converted to columner format for faster queries

#### Release [0.18.0](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/milestone/1)

Leo: We should release 0.18.0 once the GRPC documentation is done.
Michael: We should ship the slim images with the alpha caveat.

#### [SSL server failed to start](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/860)

Leo: There is an issue where civetweb isn't statically linking against openssl. This causes Falco's Civet Webserver to use the system OpenSSL and not the bundled one, which clearly can be different both in version and APIs.
Michael: There's an old email that I sent in chat http://lists.busybox.net/pipermail/buildroot/2013-September/078906.html
Leo: We will look at this 

#### Cloud-Native Security Hub

No one in charge of this matter joined the call.

#### [gRPC output documentation](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/859)

Leo: Me and Lorenzo working on this, started today. 

The discussion goes on ...

Michael: We could ask users to use gRPC to implement a Prometheus endpoint ...
JP Lachance: Doing so we'd have the problem when using various Falco instances
Leo: We do not have a fanout mechanism for output events yet

The discussion shifted to discussing the fanout mechanism, see [falco#857](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/857).
And also the gRPC aggregator proposal by Leo and Lorenzo, see [falco#824](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/824).

#### [auto-gathering latest release tag on Falco website](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/pull/83)

Leo thanks Thomas for this.

Also during the discussion, various possibilities to trigger this automatically have emerged.

Lorenzo: We could use Netlify API.
Thomas: We could use github post-hook also.
Leo: Yeah, we could use serverside post-hooks or also GitHub actions, I would vote for netlify API because that mechanism is passive. It listens and then react triggering a build, which in turn makes Netlify gathering the latest release tag and so on.


#### [Falco slim docker images](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/776)

Michael: Should be ready to be merged in. We should also notify users that this are new images so we need feedbacks.
JP Lachance: There is the problem in building the new images yet?
Michael: You could try to build the image locally and push it on your Docker Hub account.
Leo: What was this problem? Is it in the related PR or some issues? Could you please folks report this kind of problems publicly into GitHub so to make others aware of them?
JP Lachance: It's something happened 1 month ago, not remembering at the moment.

#### [PSP rules support](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/826)
