    -[Lore/Nova] Starting to add videos to falco.org 


### Agenda

- [Lore] What can we do to improve the community calls process
    - We need an MC for next week: Spencer
- [Lore] Release team for 0.26.0
    - Leonardo Di Donato volunteered
    - Leonardo Grasso voluntereed
    - Kris Nova voluntereed
    - Nova set up invite and sent to the mailing list for tomorrow 10am to 12pm Pacific
    - Spencer volunteers for 0.27.0 team
- [Lore/Leo] Talk about the eBPF runtime issues
    - Working on a fix, does not load in > 5.8.5 kernels
- [Leo/Lore] falco-driver-loader-improvements
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1408
- [Leo/Lore] driverkit improvements about ubuntu[-aws]
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/driverkit/pull/69
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/test-infra/pull/172
    - Release v0.1.0
- [Chichi Weng] [Falco overhead](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/1404)
    - For the disk write slowed down: @loris was suggesting that we can try to profile what happens in this scenario. However this looks like more an issue in the engine since not a lot of rules are hit in a situation like that. The CPU usage is related to the amount of events, this is a known limitation. We can probably improve the situation by doing filtering in the driver. Tl;dr: 24% percent is probably something to take into account if you want to run falco in a machine with that usage pattern.
    - First experiment we can do is to put an UF_ALWAYS_DROP in https://github.com/draios/sysdig/blob/dev/driver/syscall_table.c#L59 to see how it behaves.
    - Lorenzo to copy this context to the issue
- [Chichi Weng] [cn_proc+netlink](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/1397)
    - Chichi shared their use case, as described in the issue
        - Instead of monitoring every single syscall, only process, fork, exec are dealt with. This is faster but less complete.
    - Loris suggests that since Falco is very generic in the inputs this can be added as another use case
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1398/files
    - Can be written as an userspace input, example here: https://github.com/fntlnz/userspace-example
- [mstemm] [Falco Exceptions Proposal](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1376)
- [Loris] Update on rules engine performance
- [Fahad/MattCaya] Operational stability
    - Bintray storage limit for pre-built drivers   (https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/1399)
    - Kris to implement the last part of cleanup artifacts proposal: archive "old" drivers cleanup artifacts proposal to S3 and make falco-driver-loader lookup for them there too

### Closing

- **MC Next Call**: Spencer Krum
- **Next Release**: (Lead: Kris Nova), (Help: Leonardo Di Donato) on 17th Sept
