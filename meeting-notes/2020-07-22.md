### Agenda

 - [Nova] Follow up on build
     - What does the build mean?
     - Facilities / Helpers - with test suite
     - What is it responsible for?
         - Building the binaries, linking the deps
         - Bundling
         - Set of preperations / operations for the tests - even for the docker images for thest
         - packages (.deb, .rpm)
         - Leo uses cmake variant for different build environments (falco without tests, with tests, debug, release, etc)
     - How do we make folks self sufficent for drivers?
     - How does https://lists.cncf.io/g/cncf-falco-dev/message/112 fit into this (if at all?)
 - [Nova] Milestone planning
     - Nova to send async note out about 0.25 planning 
     - Any thoughts on the best way to do this?
     - Any thoughts on features/work that would make the most sense for the next (kubecon) release
 - [Nova] The CNCF is blocking us again, so we need to figure out what we want to do about the service desk - ideally more than just myself should be able to work here
 - [Nova] Anyone interested in setting up a Falco 0.24 cluster? We can make it happen if anyone else wants to demo.
