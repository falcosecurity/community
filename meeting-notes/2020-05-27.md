### This week highlights

- [leodido/fntlnz]: working on the gRPC CPU issue
  * https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/1126
  * fixes do not improve the CPU situation very much 
  * bug requires another gRPC service (bidirectional type) to be written (WIP)
  * while working on this, we tested various CPU profilers against Falco, they are all good but we still need to do FPRO (will discuss the reasons in the call)
  * Nova was able to reproduce - blocked on 1126 and then we can break off to start trying to debug intense memory/cpu issues with the profiler
