**Proposals / Discussions**

- Recording
    - We record the Office Hours call
    - The recordings will be published on the Falco YouTube channel
- We want to use HackMD to write meeting notes during Office Hours (collaboratively)
    - It can be synced to a Github repository
    - HackMD notes can be created from templates
    - Kris says that there is a plugin to convert google docs to HackMD documents, too
    - This should make the process of taking and storing notes easier
- Marky had a question about labels/process/office hours
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/office-hours/issues/35
- Current office hours process
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/office-hours
    - Leo briefly explain the concepts and structure in place for Office Hours
    - Issue templates to help people opening/categorize issues - ie. proposals/discussions
    - Issues kinds:
        - kind/issue (to talk about a Falco issue)
        - kind/pr (to talk about a Falco PR)
        - kind/debugging-hours (to demo something or ask for help live)
    - We'll keep as it is for now; we can always propose changes to the process too, through Office Hours calls!
- Lo to demo troubleshooting/kernel testing framework
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/office-hours/issues/39
    - Kernel is built and prepared
    - Rootfs is created from docker image
    - Go based init system allows a shell on the resulting vm
    - Test environment can be used to troubleshoot problems or run test harnesses
- Kris to demo falconieri (falcoctl)
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/office-hours/issues/40
    - From 0 to Falco as quickly as possible
    - The goal is to eventually have a CLI tool to perform CRUD actions on the Falco "cluster"
    - The end user can use falcoctl to install cluster, delete, etc
        - Current challenge: POC has k8s specs hardcoded, how to extract
        - Eventually want to use Falco operator for install
        - Eventually give user choice on how to install (Operator, helm, etc)
        - Eventually as a kubectl plugin
        - Move the tool to the falcosecurity organization
    - It will handle the repositories for probes, rules etc. too
    - It currently uses the falco docker slim image
- Marky about the creation of a new automated release process for Falco
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/office-hours/issues/26
    - Initial new process proposed by Leo is at https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/726#issuecomment-515068046
    - He takes owenrship of the whole process of separating build and release process from internal Sysdig infrastructure
    - We built up an infrastructure (not in the CNCF) which is separated from Sysdig (but Sysdig pays for it right now)
    - Questions about access (and privileges) to this infrastructure
    - We are moving from TravisCI towards Jenkins X
    - Github Actions have restrictions and costs money
    - Take into account also the change of the default branch of the Falco repository (where we should tag releases)
        - https://github.com/falcosecurity/office-hours/issues/30
- Ducy to demo slim images
    - https://github.com/falcosecurity/office-hours/issues/41
    - The httploader (go binary) is ~8MB
    - Image size went down to ~220MB from ~700MB
    - The minimal image is ~26MB
    - Need to work on the detecting and un-loading of the kernel module in case it is already loaded
    - In future it can be untied to the sysdig repo for the probe
