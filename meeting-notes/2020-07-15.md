### Agenda

- [nova] 0.25 Planning meeting time 
    - To be planned (next week)
- [nova] Falcoctl release
    - [leogr] released v0.1.0 to freeze the current state (although some outdated stuff is still present)
    - [leogr] I had started refactoring it (in the [chore/new-falcoctl branch](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl/tree/chore/new-falcoctl)) but was blocked by some missing feature on Falco (now unblocked)
    - [leogr] I volunteer to take care of it
- [nova] Follow up on `userspace` PR
    - [leodido,fntlnz] Review process, thoughts
        - Userspace instrumentation tools?
        - [leodido] pdig needs to graduate as Falco project ([pdig#16](https://github.com/falcosecurity/pdig/issues/16))
        - Write 3-4 lines of explaination for the release blog post -> Kris help!
        - https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1195
- [leogr/tlabarussias/nibalizer] Migrating other Helm charts
    - [leogr] I believe we all agree to move all chart's sources into the [falcosecurity/charts](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts) repository
    - Thus, [charts#47](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/issues/47) should be marked as "won't fix"
- [nibz] Cool stuff: Ansible playbook for Falco: [juju4/ansible-falco](https://github.com/juju4/ansible-falco)
    - Already linked into third-party integrations on https://falco.org
- [fntlnz] Clang 10,11 support for eBPF probe
    - Related to https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/1251
- [fntlnz] New syscall supported renameat2, execveat coming
- [fntlnz] Release changelog automation needs to stay in the cluster
    - right now it's here still https://fs.fntlnz.wtf/falco/milestones-changelog.txt
- [leodido] Improvements to the integration test suite
    - [falco#1313](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1313)
- [nova] ARM update

```
WARNING: "__aeabi_uldivmod" [/home/novix/falco/build/driver/src/falco.ko] undefined!
insmod: ERROR: could not insert module driver/falco.ko: Unknown symbol in module
```

I think we need to use `do_div()` from `<asm/div64.h>` for 64 bit division in the driver :/ 

This is relevant to the arm chip being used, everything armv8 and above is 64 bit 

### Closing

- **MC Next Call**: leogr/kris
- **Next Release**: [0.24.0](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/milestone/10) on July, 16th (leodido,leogr)
