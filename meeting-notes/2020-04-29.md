### Agenda
- [leogr,maxgio92] Update on [the community repo](github.com/falcosecurity/community)
    - Integrations added to the contrib repo [contrib#3](https://github.com/falcosecurity/contrib/pull/3)
    - Ready to move integrations away from the Falco repo [falco#1157](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1157)
    - Do we want to change the README.md?
    - Related documentation changes on Falco.org
- [lore] What do we want to do with the probeloader in Go? People are using it in the wild and mentioning it in the issues, like [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/897#issuecomment-620840925) - we need to decide wether to update t to follow the new structure or delete it in favor of something else. What?
    - Decision to support the following:
      - [container image] falco userspace program (unprivileged)
      - [container image] falco driver loader (*privileges - bash script on host)
      - [container image] falco installer (*privileges - bash script on host)
      - [application] falcoctl "wraps" these containers with CLI convenience for easy <5min install
      - [remove] slim image
      - [remove] minimal image
      - [remove] probe loader functionality from falcoctl 
      - [replace] probe loader docker image with bash script instead of falcoctl
    - [leogr] see [contrib#5]
    - (https://github.com/falcosecurity/contrib/issues/5)
- [kris] Updates on the new documentation structure
    -  related PR [falco-website#184](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-website/pull/184)
    -  blocked on understanding the docker directory in the falco repo

- [leodido,fntlnz] Pre-built driver updates!
    - `falco-driver-loader` has already been updated to lookup for prebuilt drivers at the new location

    - documentation
    - autocomplete for bash,zsh,fish
    - [leogr] added goreleaser to driverkit [driverkit#63](https://github.com/falcosecurity/driverkit/pull/63)
- [lore] We probably need to release Falco as soon as Kernel 5.6 support is merged. There are many distros out there shipping it already and it's incompatible because of the y2038 bug.
- [lore,leo] update on the profiler
- [lore,leo] update on backports from CentOS that break our compatiblity with some kernels [falco#1129](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/1129)
