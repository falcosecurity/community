     - https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1099
     - Once we merge it, hold a while before tagging
     - PR is merged on master: it will be released as a _development_ version of Falco automatically on [bintray](https://bintray.com/falcosecurity) (packages, \*-dev repositories) and on docker hub (master-\* tags)
 - [Kris] Update on hubs
     - More from the CNCF call(s)
     - Falco needs to take a stance with builds / artifacts
     - No decision yet. Various concerns by different stakeholders
     - As a project we need to decide what artifacts we wish to support
     - Kris to open issues for the various concerns to allow the community to start discussing
- [Leo/Lore] Update on Driverkit
    - Try to build flatcar using vanilla, if it works...
    -  Create a specific target for flatcar for maintenability
    -  Linuxkit in the making but there are issues with the RANDSTRUCT seed because Docker for Mac, Docker for Desktop recompile the linuxkit kernel (which uses another seed w.r.t the one shipped by the linukit kernel docker image)
    -  Document this into the website: https://github.com/falcosecurity/driverkit/issues/23 
- [Leo/Lore] Update on Drivers Build Grid
    - By the end of the next week it will be ready,
    - Wiring up last things together
- [Natch] How to install the eBPF probe or the kernle module?
    - for the eBPF probe use `FALBO_BPF_PROBE=""` env variable
    - for the kernel module we'll change the `falco-probe-loader` script logic (also renaming it)
    - for now just use `insmod`
    - also `falcoctl` ? only `falcoctl` ?
- [Leo Grasso] integrate driverkit into falcoctl
