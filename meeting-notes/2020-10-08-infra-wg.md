### This week highlights


### Agenda



- Review Jonah's Pr to Max's PR
- - Who launches the EKS clusters and when?
    - CircleCI, Github Actions or Atlantis?
        - team: circle ci runs terraform
    - Investigate CircleCI Terraform
        -[umang] https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/circle-ci

    - options for secrets:
        - circleci holds secrets, adds to k8s with kubectl in job
            - circleci pulls from 1password in job [+1]
        - out of band admin applies secrets
    - Run both terraform and kube in the build/deploy step
    - 1password cli: https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/
```bash
#example ci job script
#!/bin/bash
cd prow/config
terraform apply
cd ../..
cd <dir with kube files>
# circlci lays down some secret.yaml files ?
./pull_secrets_1password # implies a secret to 1p from circleci
# note if ^^ script turns out to be hard lwe'll put the secrets in circleci
kubectl apply -f ./prow
```
- [leodido] CNCF service ticket for *.falco.org subdomains - we need the CNAME
    - need a name:
        - prow.falco.org [accepted]
    - blocked on running terraform and then kubectl apply
        - elb would then be created
        - eg: adf8xxxxx40a187a848fxxxxxx-xxxxxxxx.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
- [jonah] 1Password blocking migration need to figure it out
    - solution is to inject secrets into circleci ?
- Which Region? (Where are the majority of users based from)
    - where is the bintray hosted/jfrog hosted? (does this matter if s3 is hosting drivers?)
    - us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
    - eu-west-1 (Ireland)

- Which instance types
    - what nodes for eks clusters 
        - general purpose type (m) [+1] 
        - burstable type (t)
        - memory heavy types (r)
        - cpu heavy types (c) 
    - plan:
        - start with general purpose type (m) and evaluate cpu heavy types (c) for the driver build jobs/nodes
- [jonah] Migration path proposal
    - jonah to create migration plan doc
