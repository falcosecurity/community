### Agenda

    - Support for userspace instrumentation
    - Fix to build the eBPF driver on CentOS 8
    - Const correctness of libscap classes
    - New prebuilt drivers coming soon
- [leodido] Fix for Falco statistics in merge queue! ([falco#1308](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1308))
- [fntlnz,leodido] Falco logs not appearing (see [this comment](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/1291#issuecomment-652440564))
- [khaize,leodido] Placeholder macros for rules customizations ([falco#1294](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1294))
- [leogr] Rename `SKIP_MODULE_LOAD` to `SKIP_DRIVER_LOADER` ([falco#1297](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1297))
- [leogr] Print the Falco and driver versions at the very beginning of the output ([falco#1303](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/1303))
- Helm charts
  - [tlabarussias/armin] Request inclusion to hub.helm.sh ([charts#40](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/issues/40), [slack thread](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/CMWH3EH32/p1593965635011300))
  - [leogr] Releasing automation ([charts#22](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/issues/22))
    - [xantrix] PR [charts#31](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts/pull/31) (almost done) implements the automatation for charts included in the same repo
    - what to do with charts in other repos?
        - Charts to live near the source code? eg., falcosidekick
            - pros: simpler release process, locality
        - Or do we want to use falcosecurity/charts as single source of truth?
            - cons: how to release different helm chart for different Falco component (eg. falco-exporter)?
        - issif wants charts source to live near falcosidekick source
        - leogr wants the same too, but he prefers the helm artifacts and manifest to be in falcosecurity/charts
            - so we are talking about a process that crosses different github repos
            - spencer also wants this

### Closing

- **MC Next Call**: Leo Grasso
- **Next Release**: [0.24.0](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/milestone/10) on July, 16th (leodido,leogr)
