# Community-appreciation-program

We are a community of passionate folks who love open source, community, and Falco. We also want to recognize the work the community contributes to the project. The community understands that contributions are crucial to the development of the project and we could not be where we are today without YOU! 

To show our appreciation we want to award cool swag to the individuals that help keep Falco growing and moving forward. In 2023, we are rolling out a swag appreciation program for the community. Remember these programs are evergreen and feedback and suggestions are welcomed. If you have ideas on how to improve this page and program - reach out and file an issue in the community repo. 

If youâ€™re helping the Falco community with contributions, please let us know!  Here are the contribution criteria and swag award types. Happy contributing!
