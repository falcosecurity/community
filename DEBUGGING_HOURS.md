# Debugging hours

Debugging hours play a role when someone wants the help of others debugging an issue
they have with Flaco, either if it is an issue using it or developing against it!

The other purpose of the debugging hours is to offload discussions from the office hours
to a meeting solely dedicated to a specific issue.

Debugging hours are not scheduled in advance, what happens is that the person that wants to propose a topic
just opens an issue with `/kind debugging-hours` proposing a debugging topic and put your availability to do a call in it.

Others will comment on your issue with their availability and stating their experience on the topic, then we all get together and do the debugging session
at the scheduled time!
