# Debugging hours

Debugging hours play a role when someone wants the help of others debugging an issue
they have with Falco, either if it is an issue using it or developing against it!

The other purpose of the debugging hours is to offload discussions from the community call
to a meeting solely dedicated to a specific issue.

Debugging hours are not scheduled in advance, what happens is that the person that needs help just opens an issue with the "Debuggin hours" template proposing a debugging topic and puts in your availability to do a call.

Others will comment on your issue with their availability and stating their experience on the topic, then we all get together and do the debugging session
at the scheduled time!
